# The-Simon-Game

The Simon Game is a memory skill game with lights and sounds which requires the user to repeat the sequence that is played in the
correct order.

Still need to add an animation to the counter which fades in and down. 
The red and yellow buttons move when start button pressed which I need to change.
Want to find a better way to reset the game once a mistake is made rather than reloading the page which is a bit sneaky.
